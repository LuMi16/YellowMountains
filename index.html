 <p> <b>Yellow Mountains</b> (Chinese: <b>Huangshan</b> 黄山), is a mountain range in southern Anhui province in eastern China.
  Vegetation on the range is thickest below 1,100 meters (3,600 ft), with trees growing up to the treeline at 1,800 meters (5,900 ft).
  The area is well known for its scenery, sunsets, peculiarly-shaped granite peaks, Huangshan pine trees, hot springs, winter snow, and views of the clouds from above.
  Huangshan is a frequent subject of traditional Chinese paintings and literature, as well as modern photography.
  It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of China's major tourist destinations.
  Huangshan is also the famous place for Chinese teas of high quality, such as Huangshan Maofeng, Keemun Black, and Blooming Tea.
